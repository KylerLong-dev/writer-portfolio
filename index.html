                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Doug Long is based along Florida's Gulf Coast and often writes about nature and place and worlds
                    that define who we are. Through travels, his stories take readers across North America.<br><br>
                    Published in literary issues, online sites and journals internationally, he recently completed the manuscript 
                    for his first book:  Summer Wind - An American Traveler's History Journal.<br><br>
                    In his words, "I think writing offers the unique opportunity to connect with readers on an emotional level. 
                    Whether it was a hundred years ago or yesterday, my words attempt to help people feel like they are there. 
                    In the essay, Reflections in the Maine Light, I want them to feel the oncoming storm, wind on a rock-strewn beach;
                    the loneliness of a desolate island. It makes them part of the story."
